            <p id="title">Engr. Ime Obot Etuk</p>
            <div id="about-info1">
                <p> He was a kind man. Engr. Ime who was fondly called mark by his friends,<br/>
                was a peace-loving and sociable person. He hated to see situations where the strong 
                oppressed the weak or where people were abused.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="about-info2">
                </p>Engr. Ime Isaiah Obot Etuk hated lies with passion. He was a man of honour,
                principle and dignity. His love was unconditional. He was bold, brave and 
                and full of energy. Laziness was never part of who he was. Ever ready and 
                ever active man. Very intelligent and sweet to be with.</p>
                
                <p>Because of this man, many people will always have food on their table.
                He dedicated his time and energy training several other young men to 
                be as good and even better than he was in the field of marine engineering.
                He saved lives through his kind gestures. He is a true hero of our time.</p>

                <p>In the city of Port-harcourt, he met and worked with several foreign engineers
                in the oil and gas companies. Most of whom had recommended him to other companies
                that needed such expatriate. He treated strangers like family with no form of 
                discrimination. They always called him 'brother' due to how he loved and 
                protected them.</p>

                <p>A man that worried so much about the welfare of others. A true leader and friends.
                He was like a father, a bother and a friend to those who knew him well. He loved
                God and the things of God with all his might. Whenever there was a little time 
                from his duties, the house of God his dwelling place. He respected people whom 
                God has called to lead. He was always ready to serve.</p>

                <p id="hero">This 'hero' will be greatly missed.</p>

                <h4>Port-harcourt Oil Company</h4>
                <p>The city of Port-harcourt experienced his greatness both on land 
                    and in the sea. He was one of the engineers Wilbros Engineering 
                    has ever had. He was fearless and dedicated to his duties at all 
                    times. Back then he used to talk about life in the sea as a marine
                    and ship engineer. He wouldn't answe calls when he is under the 
                    machines in the marine. He was so good at his job that it was really
                    hard letting him go.

                    <p>He was a very good man.<br/>
                    I wish good people like you can live 
                    much longer and if possibly,forever.
                    Above all He was caring,soft-hearted and God fearing.
